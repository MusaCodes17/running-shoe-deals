# Running Shoe Deal Finder - Project State 📋

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-22  
**Project Status:** Phase 5 In Progress  
**Current Focus:** Product images, colorway consolidation, scraper durability + coverage

---

## 🆕 Sporting Life investigated — blocked by Cloudflare, not added — 2026-06-22

**[BLOCKED] Sporting Life (sportinglife.ca) cannot be scraped without a paid unblocking service.**
- Ran the same platform-detection pass used for En Route Run. Unlike that case, the blocker
  isn't the Demandware platform — the entire site sits behind a **Cloudflare managed JS
  challenge**. Plain HTTP requests to any path, including `/robots.txt`, return `403` with a
  "Just a moment..." challenge page.
- Tried a real headless Chromium (via the project's own Playwright, the same engine used for
  Algolia credential rediscovery) with full JS execution and `networkidle` wait — still stuck
  on the challenge. Cloudflare's bot-management fingerprints headless automation itself, not
  just missing JS.
- Same bucket as Adidas, Nike, and MEC (already excluded/removed for being bot-protected) —
  not the "needs a bespoke parser" bucket En Route Run was in. Getting past this reliably would
  need a paid proxy/unblocking service (e.g. ScraperAPI, Bright Data) or fingerprint-evasion
  tooling, a different order of cost/effort than a normal new-retailer scraper.
- **Not added.** No retailer row, no scraper file. Table below updated to reflect why.

## 🆕 New retailer — En Route Run (headless Shopify, JSON-LD doesn't have enough) — 2026-06-22

**[ADDED] `EnRouteRunScraper`** (`app/scrapers/enroute_run.py`), registered in `ScraperManager`.
- Site is Shopify-backed (`cdn.shopify.com` / `myshopify.com` in page source) but runs a
  **headless Astro storefront** — none of the usual Shopify endpoints work: `/products.json`
  404s, `/products/<handle>.js` 404s, `/search/suggest.json` is unusable. So it's neither
  plug-and-play `ShopifyScraper` nor Algolia; needed a bespoke scraper.
- The page's `<script type="application/ld+json">` `Product` block has price/availability per
  variant but **no `compareAtPrice`**, so it can't tell a real markdown from full price.
  Instead, every page (product pages *and* `/search?q=` results) embeds the Shopify Storefront
  API's variant data inline as HTML-entity-encoded Astro/Qwik hydration JSON
  (`&quot;availableForSale&quot;:[0,true]…&quot;price&quot;…&quot;compareAtPrice&quot;…`).
  `_parse_variant_blocks()` unescapes + regex-parses these blocks directly (no JSON endpoint
  needed) — same block also gives the "Colour / Size" variant title, parent product title +
  handle, and image. Blocks repeat several times per page (buy box, recommendation widgets) so
  results are deduped by `(handle, variant_title)`.
- `get_product_details` applies the same available-variants-only price logic as the Shopify
  variant-price fix above (prefers cheapest available variant with a real markdown, falls back
  to cheapest available full price). `search_products` parses `/search?q=` result cards
  (`<a href="/products/...">` + adjacent `<img alt="... product image">`) for discovery, same
  brand/model token-matching convention as the other scrapers.
- Verified live: Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 — men's $225 (was $300), women's $210 (was $300),
  both genuine markdowns, both flowed through as real deals end-to-end.

---

## 🆕 Stale data after shoe rename — 2026-06-19

**[FIXED] Renaming a shoe's brand/model left old scraped data displayed under the new name.**
- Root cause: `PUT /api/shoes/{id}` (`shoes.py`) overwrote `brand`/`model` with no side effects.
  Deals/price_records are keyed by `shoe_id`, not by what was actually scraped, so renaming
  (e.g. Asics "Magic Speed 4" → "Magic Speed 5", Brooks "Hyperion 3" → "Hyperion Elite 6")
  left deals from the *old*, correctly-matched model name still active — now displayed
  mislabeled as the new model. Verified live: both "new" models don't exist at any retailer yet
  (`search_products` returns 0 hits); the displayed cards were stale prior-model data.
- Fix (`shoes.py` `update_shoe`): when `brand` or `model` changes, all active deals for that
  shoe are deactivated immediately so a rename can't keep showing the previous model's data.
- Cleanup: deactivated the 8 already-affected stale deals; re-scraped to confirm no new
  (incorrect) deals were created.

---

## 🆕 Scrapability check — auto-check removed, manual test retained — 2026-06-19

**[OPTIMIZED] Removed auto-scrapability check on Shoes page load.**
- Root cause: the Shoes page (`frontend/src/pages/Shoes.jsx`) ran a concurrency-limited
  `useEffect` that called `POST /api/shoes/test` for every active shoe on every load — each
  test sequentially hits all scraping-enabled retailers, so a list of ~20+ shoes meant the page
  stayed in a "Checking…" state for minutes and issued a large burst of real requests against
  external retailer sites on every visit.
- **[REMOVED]** The auto-check `useEffect`, the per-shoe `scrapability` state map, and the
  "Scrapeable" status-badge column from the Shoes table.
- **[RETAINED]** The "Test Scrapability" button + `ScrapabilityTestModal` on the add/edit shoe
  form (`ShoeForm.jsx`) — unchanged, still tests on demand before/without saving.
- **[ADDED]** A per-row "Test" icon button (flask icon) in the Shoes table Actions column —
  on-demand only, calls `POST /api/shoes/test` for that one shoe and reuses
  `ScrapabilityTestModal` to show the breakdown + a Re-test button. Never fires automatically.
- Backend (`POST /api/shoes/test`, `ScraperManager.test_shoe_scrapability`) unchanged — it was
  always on-demand; only the frontend's auto-invocation was removed.
- Result: Shoes page now loads immediately (table renders with the existing shoe-list query
  only, no bulk scrapability calls); validation still happens exactly where it matters — when
  adding/editing a shoe, or via the optional per-row "Test" button.

---

## 🆕 Shopify variant-price fix — 2026-06-18 (phantom deals from sold-out sale colorways)

**[FIXED] Phantom deals from Shopify's product-level price ignoring stock.**
- Root cause: Shopify's product-level `price` field is the **minimum price across all
  variants, including sold-out ones**. A sale colorway (e.g. $150, `compare_at_price` $300)
  could be completely sold out while other colorways remained in stock at full price ($300) —
  but the scraper read the product-level $150 alongside `available: true` (true because of the
  in-stock full-price colorways), creating a deal nobody could actually buy. Verified live:
  BlackToe's `adidas-womens-adizero-adios-pro-4` has six sale-priced colorways ($150–$180,
  `compare_at_price` $300) all `available: false`, while every in-stock variant is $300 full price.
- Fix (`shopify_scraper.get_product_details`): price/original_price are now derived from
  **available variants only** — prefers the cheapest available variant with a real markdown
  (`compare_at_price > price`); falls back to the cheapest available full-price variant if none
  of the in-stock variants are on sale. Keeps `in_stock` and `price` referring to the same
  variant pool instead of two different ones.

---

## 🆕 Deal detection fix — 2026-06-18 (require actual markdown, not just target hit)

**[FIXED] Deals were created for full-price items that merely hit the target price.**
- Root cause: `scraper_manager._create_deal`'s trigger was `price <= shoe.target_price` only —
  no check that the retailer was actually discounting. Since most shoes' `target_price` in seed
  data sits at/near MSRP, full-price listings across every retailer qualified as "deals" with
  0% savings (e.g. Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 at BlackToe Running: $300 full price, no
  `compare_at_price`, target also $300 → false deal). Verified live via BlackToe's
  `/products/<handle>.js` endpoint.
- Fix (`scraper_manager.py`): a deal now requires `on_sale` (`original_price` present and
  `> price`) **in addition to** `price <= target_price`. Hitting your target at full price no
  longer creates a deal.
- Cleanup: deactivated 185 of 268 existing active deals that had no real markdown (DB backup:
  `backend/shoe_deals.db.bak_pre_dealfix`). 83 genuine markdown-based deals remain.

---

## 🆕 Phase 5 — 2026-06-18 (images, colorway consolidation, rediscovery, +3 retailers)

**Task 2 — Product images + colorway (data foundation).**
- New nullable columns `image_url` + `colorway` on `price_records` **and** `deals`
  (migration `backend/migrate_add_images.py`, idempotent `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`; backup `.db.bak`).
- Scrapers now return both fields: Algolia (`image_url` = S3 CDN URL; colorway from the
  `thumbnails[].color_name` matching the primary image), Shopify (`image`/`featured_image`,
  protocol-relative URLs normalized to `https:`; colorway from the product's Color option).
- `scraper_manager` threads them into `_record_price` + `_create_deal` (existing deals backfill
  images on re-scrape even when price is unchanged). Dashboard + price-history endpoints expose them.
- Schemas: added to `PriceRecordBase` + `DealBase` → flow through `DealResponse` to the UI.

**Task 3 — Colorway consolidation UI (client-side grouping).**
- `Deals.jsx` groups active deals by `shoe_id` → **one card per model** instead of N near-identical
  cards (Boston 13's colorways/retailers now consolidate into a single card).
- New `ShoeProductCard.jsx` (large primary image, price/savings, promo, retailer + buy link) and
  `ColorwaySelector.jsx` (thumbnail gallery; clicking switches the active colorway/retailer).
  `DealDetailModal` now shows the product image too. Placeholder icon when image is null
  (old image-less deals still render).

**Task 1 — Automatic Algolia credential rediscovery (durability).**
- `base_scraper.discover_algolia_credentials(homepage_url, search_selector)` drives the site's own
  search with headless Playwright and intercepts the `*.algolia.net` request to recover the app id,
  search key, and (base, replica-stripped) index name.
- `algolia_scraper._algolia_query` detects HTTP 401/403, rediscovers **once per session**, caches
  the new creds in-memory, retries, and logs a WARNING to update the hardcoded defaults. Graceful:
  returns `[]` (never throws) if rediscovery fails. **Verified** by injecting a bogus key → 403 →
  rediscovery → recovery → 5 results.

**Task 4 — +3 Shopify retailers, list reconciled.** See the retailer platform table below.
Scrapers now live (6): The Last Hunt, Altitude Sports (Algolia); JD Sports Canada,
**Boutique Endurance, Le Coureur, BlackToe Running** (Shopify). Also fixed Shopify size extraction
to locate the "Size" option by name (Le Coureur has a 3rd Width option that broke the old
`split('/')` heuristic).

---

## 🌐 Retailer Platform Analysis (Task 4)

Detection checklist for any new retailer:
- **Shopify?** → `GET /products.json` returns JSON · `/search/suggest.json?q=…` returns products ·
  homepage has `cdn.shopify.com` / `Shopify.theme` / `myshopify`. → subclass `ShopifyScraper`.
- **Algolia?** → DevTools/Playwright shows XHR to `*.algolia.net` with `x-algolia-*` headers. →
  subclass `AlgoliaScraper` (discover creds via the rediscovery helper).
- **FGL/Canadian Tire** (Sport Experts, Sport Chek) or **Custom/brand** (Adidas, Nike, MEC) →
  needs a bespoke scraper; leave `scraping_enabled=False`.

| Retailer | Platform | Scraper | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Last Hunt | Algolia | ✅ | index `PRODUCTS_TLH_en-CA` |
| Altitude Sports | Algolia | ✅ | index `PRODUCTS_ALS_en-CA` |
| JD Sports Canada | Shopify | ✅ | |
| Boutique Endurance | Shopify | ✅ | `/en` locale required |
| Le Coureur | Shopify | ✅ | `/en` locale; some titles stay French |
| BlackToe Running | Shopify | ✅ | English-only |
| ForeRunners | Shopify | ✅ | `shop.forerunners.ca`; suggest.json occasionally 503s (transient) |
| En Route Run | Shopify (headless Astro) | ✅ | no `/products.json`/`.js`/`suggest.json` — parses inline variant hydration JSON instead, see changelog |
| Sport Experts | FGL/Canadian Tire | ❌ future | custom platform |
| Sporting Life | Salesforce Commerce Cloud / Demandware | ❌ blocked | Cloudflare managed JS challenge on every page (even `/robots.txt`) — 403s plain requests AND headless Playwright (fingerprinted as bot). Not a "needs a parser" case like En Route Run; would need a paid unblocking/proxy service to get past. See 2026-06-22 changelog. |

_Removed retailers (no longer tracked): RunAsYouAre (custom front-end), Adidas & Nike (brand sites, bot-protected)._

**Keeping the DB in sync with seed_data.py:** `RETAILERS`/`SHOES` in `backend/seed_data.py` are the
source of truth. `python seed_data.py` inserts anything missing (additive, safe);
`python seed_data.py --sync` reconciles fully — inserts missing **and deletes** retailers/shoes not
listed (cascades to their price_records/deals). Newly-added retailers are platform-detected; Shopify/
Algolia ones get a scraper subclass + registration immediately.

---

## 🆕 Session Changelog — 2026-06-18 (scraper migration + new retailers)

**The Last Hunt migrated off CSS selectors → Algolia API.**
- Root cause recap: TLH is a Next.js storefront; products render client-side, so CSS scraping found nothing.
- Discovered (via Playwright network interception) that TLH's catalogue is a **commercetools** backend exposed through a **public Algolia** index its own frontend queries. One Algolia request returns name, price, original price, stock (`quantity_left`) and available sizes — no browser, no HTML parsing.
- New `app/scrapers/algolia_scraper.py` — generic `AlgoliaScraper` base (mirrors the `ShopifyScraper` pattern). `the_last_hunt.py` is now a thin subclass holding only its public Algolia app id / search key / index (`PRODUCTS_TLH_en-CA`).
- Verified live: Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 found at **$185.99 (was $299.99)**, in stock, 8 sizes. Returns 0 (correctly) for models TLH doesn't carry.

**Altitude Sports wired up (new retailer).**
- Altitude shares TLH's parent company and runs the **identical Next.js + commercetools + Algolia stack**, so it reuses `AlgoliaScraper`. New `app/scrapers/altitude_sports.py` (index `PRODUCTS_ALS_en-CA`); registered in `ScraperManager`.
- Verified live: Altitude carries the **Adidas Adizero Boston 13** (5 hits) and Saucony Endorphin (13 hits).

**Shopify survey result: JD Sports is the only Shopify retailer.**
- Probed Altitude, Sport Experts, MEC, Running Room, Sport Chek for Shopify fingerprints (`/products.json`, `suggest.json`, `cdn.shopify.com`). **None are Shopify.** Sport Experts + Sport Chek are the FGL/Canadian Tire platform; MEC is custom (403s bots); Running Room serves HTML only.
- Those 4 have no scraper, so `scraping_enabled` was set to **False** (seed + live DB) to stop "No scraper implemented" noise on every scrape. Re-enable any from the Retailers page once a scraper exists.

**Scrapers now live (3):** The Last Hunt (Algolia), Altitude Sports (Algolia), JD Sports Canada (Shopify). Added `GET /api/scrape/test/altitude-sports`.

## 🆕 Session Changelog — 2026-06-17 (all 4 critical bugs fixed)

**[FIXED] Issue 1 — Removed `size` field from Shoe model.**
- Why: a single exact size (e.g. "10.5") made the scraper miss the model when that size was out of stock.
- Changes: dropped `size` column (`models.py`), removed it from `ShoeBase`/`ShoeUpdate` (`schemas.py`), the `ShoeForm`/`Shoes` table/deal cards (frontend), `seed_data.py`, `dashboard.py` best/recent deals, and `view_db.py`. Dedup is now brand+model.
- Migration: `backend/migrate_remove_size.py` (idempotent `ALTER TABLE shoes DROP COLUMN size`, SQLite ≥3.35). Ran against existing DB — 12 shoes preserved. Backup at `shoe_deals.db.bak`.
- `PriceRecord.size_available` now means "at least one size in stock" rather than "our exact size".

**[FIXED] Issue 2 — Target-price changes now persist into deals.**
- Root cause: the PUT endpoint + React Query invalidation were actually correct; the bug was in deal detection. Existing deals never had their `target_price`/savings refreshed, and deals were never deactivated when the target dropped below the current price.
- Changes (`scraper_manager.py`): `_create_deal` now also updates `existing_deal.target_price` and recomputes savings whenever price **or** target changed; new `_deactivate_deal()` retires a deal when the scraped price is above the current target. Deal detection always reads the freshly-loaded `shoe.target_price`.
- Verified: raise target above price → deal deactivates; restore → deal reappears with recomputed savings.

**[FIXED] Issue 3 — Export DB back to `seed_data.py`.**
- New endpoint `GET /api/export/seed-data` (`app/routers/export.py`) renders current retailers + shoes as runnable, valid `seed_data.py` source (text/plain).
- Frontend: "Export seed data" button on the Shoes page downloads `seed_data.py`.

**[FIXED] Issue 4 — JD Sports scraper (Boston 13 now found).**
- Root cause: JD Sports Canada (jdsports.ca) is a **Shopify** store; The Last Hunt is a **Next.js** app. The old CSS-selector scraper found nothing, and JD Sports had no scraper at all.
- Changes: new generic `ShopifyScraper` (`app/scrapers/shopify_scraper.py`) using Shopify JSON endpoints (`/search/suggest.json`, `/products/<handle>.js`) — far more reliable than CSS. `JDSportsScraper` (`app/scrapers/jd_sports.py`) extends it; registered in `ScraperManager` under `"JD Sports Canada"`. Added `GET /api/scrape/test/jd-sports`.
- Verified live: Boston 13 found at **$105 (was $190)**, in stock → creates a deal vs the $110/$150 target.
- ⚠️ The Last Hunt remains a Next.js site; its CSS scraper is still unreliable (see Known Issues). Other Shopify retailers (Altitude, etc.) can reuse `ShopifyScraper`.

## 🐛 Known Issues

> **All 4 issues below were FIXED on 2026-06-17** — see the Session Changelog at the top of this file. Original write-ups kept for reference.
>
> ~~Remaining limitation: The Last Hunt scraper still uses fragile CSS selectors.~~ ✅ Resolved 2026-06-18 — migrated to The Last Hunt's Algolia API (see changelog). Altitude Sports added on the same stack.

### Issue 1: Shoe Size Filtering Limits Search ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Searching by specific size (e.g., "10.5") is too restrictive  
**Impact:** Scraper misses products even if shoe is in stock  
**Solution Needed:** Remove size field from Shoe model, make size search optional/dynamic

**Current Schema:**
```python
class Shoe:
    brand: str          # Nike
    model: str          # Vaporfly
    size: str           # 10.5 <- PROBLEM: Too specific
    target_price: float
```

**Proposed Schema:**
```python
class Shoe:
    brand: str
    model: str
    # Remove size - search all sizes
    target_price: float
    # Add optional size tracking separately
    preferred_sizes: List[str] = []  # Optional
```

### Issue 2: Target Price Not Filtering After Update ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Updating target_price in UI doesn't affect scraping results  
**Possible Causes:**
- Frontend not refreshing data after update
- Backend caching target_price
- Deal detection logic using old prices
**Solution Needed:** Verify price update workflow end-to-end

### Issue 3: seed_data.py Not Synced with UI ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Adding shoes in UI doesn't persist to seed_data.py  
**Current Flow:**
1. User adds shoe via UI → Database updated ✓
2. But seed_data.py file not updated ✗
3. On reset, new shoes are lost

**Solution Needed:** Add script to export database to seed_data.py format

### Issue 4: Scraper Not Finding Boston 13 on JD Sports ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Product exists (https://jdsports.ca/collections/mens-adidas/products/adidas-adizero-boston-13-black-white-grey-1) but scraper returns no results  
**Possible Causes:**
- CSS selectors need adjustment for JD Sports (different retailer than The Last Hunt)
- Size filtering preventing match
- Search query not matching product name
**Solution Needed:**
- Add JD Sports scraper implementation
- Verify CSS selectors on JD Sports site
- Test with Boston 13 specifically

## 💡 Key Learnings & Notes

### Working Well ✅
- FastAPI backend is solid
- React frontend responsive and functional
- Dark mode implemented cleanly
- Discount code detection works
- Deal detection logic accurate

### Needs Work 🔧
- Size field too restrictive
- Price filtering not persisting properly
- Scraper needs expansion to more retailers
- seed_data.py sync missing

### Implementation Notes
- CSS selectors vary by retailer (The Last Hunt vs JD Sports)
- Browser automation (Playwright) needed for JS-heavy sites
- Rate limiting essential (2-3s delays)
- Error handling for network issues critical

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Size Field Issue Deep Dive
Current:
```python
shoe = Shoe(brand="Adidas", model="Boston 13", size="10.5")
# Scraper looks for size 10.5 specifically
# Misses size 10 or 11 even if same model
```

Better:
```python
shoe = Shoe(brand="Adidas", model="Boston 13")
# Scraper finds all sizes
# Optional: User selects sizes they want post-search
```

### Price Filter Issue Deep Dive
Steps to debug:
1. Update shoe target_price via API (`PUT /api/shoes/{id}`)
2. Verify database was updated (`SELECT * FROM shoes WHERE id=?`)
3. Trigger scrape (`POST /api/scrape/shoe/{id}`)
4. Check if deals created with new price threshold
5. If not, check deal creation logic in `scraper_manager.py`
