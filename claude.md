## 🆕 Shoe detail page, purchase price/cost-per-km, notes journal, mileage checkpoints — 2026-06-24

**[ADDED] A full `/my-shoes/:id` detail page, replacing the old quick-view dialog as the permanent home for run history.**
- New route `frontend/src/pages/ShoeDetail.jsx`. Card click target ("Details" button or the
  image/name header) now navigates here instead of opening a dialog; the old `ShoeDetailDialog`
  in `MyShoes.jsx` was removed entirely (run history moved into the new page, nothing duplicated).
- Layout: image/brand/model/nickname header with status badge and purchase-price line → stats row
  (mileage bar, total runs, lifetime avg pace/HR when present) → a **Replacement Deals** placeholder
  card (explicitly empty — "Coming soon" badge, no logic, just holding the layout slot for later) →
  **Shoe Notes Journal** → **Run History**.
- **[ADDED]** `purchase_price` (nullable float) on `owned_shoes` (migration
  `backend/migrate_add_shoe_notes.py`, same idempotent-`ALTER TABLE` pattern as prior owned_shoes
  migrations). Exposed in `OwnedShoeBase`/`Update` and as computed `cost_per_km` on
  `OwnedShoeResponse` (`purchase_price / current_mileage`, rounded 2dp, only when both are set) —
  computed server-side in `_attach_computed_fields` so the REST API, MCP tools, and frontend all
  show the identical number instead of each recomputing it. `OwnedShoeForm` gained a "Purchase
  price ($)" field.
- **[ADDED]** "Adjust mileage" action on the detail page — a small two-step dialog (enter value →
  explicit confirm showing old/new) that PUTs `current_mileage` directly via the existing
  `OwnedShoeUpdate` endpoint. Deliberately not a new endpoint — `current_mileage` was already
  updatable via `PUT /owned-shoes/{id}`; this just gives it dedicated UI with a confirmation step
  since it silently overrides accumulated run mileage rather than logging a run.

**[ADDED] Shoe Notes Journal — replaces the old single free-text `owned_shoes.notes` column.**
- New table `shoe_notes` (`id`, `owned_shoe_id`, `body`, `mileage_at_note`, `triggered_by`
  ["manual"|"checkpoint"], `created_at`) — a timestamped, mileage-anchored history instead of one
  overwritable text blob. `migrate_add_shoe_notes.py` migrates any existing `owned_shoes.notes`
  text into a `triggered_by="manual"` entry (mileage_at_note = current_mileage at migration time),
  then drops the old column. Ran live: 2 existing notes migrated cleanly.
- Endpoints (`routers/owned_shoes.py`): `GET/POST /api/owned-shoes/{id}/notes`,
  `DELETE /api/owned-shoes/notes/{note_id}`. `mileage_at_note` is always set server-side from the
  shoe's current mileage at write time — never client-supplied.
- MCP: `update_shoe_notes` removed (the column it wrote no longer exists); replaced by
  `get_shoe_notes(owned_shoe_id)` and `add_shoe_note(owned_shoe_id, body)`.
- Frontend: vertical timeline in `ShoeDetail.jsx` (date · mileage · checkpoint badge when
  applicable · body), "Add note" button, per-entry delete with confirmation, empty state.

**[ADDED] 100km mileage checkpoints prompt for a journal entry.**
- `POST /owned-shoes/{id}/log-run` now returns `LogRunResponse` (`run_logged`, `updated_mileage`,
  `checkpoint_reached`, `checkpoint_km`, `shoe`) instead of the bare shoe — a breaking response-
  shape change for that one endpoint. Checkpoint crossing is `floor(new_mileage/100) >
  floor(old_mileage/100)`, e.g. 290.06km + 10km run → checkpoint_km=300.
- New shared `frontend/src/components/LogRunDialog.jsx` — logs the run, and if `checkpoint_reached`
  is true and this checkpoint hasn't been prompted before, swaps to a "Your [shoe] just hit Xkm —
  add a note?" view. "Already prompted" is tracked client-side only
  (`frontend/src/lib/checkpoints.js`, localStorage keyed by shoe id + checkpoint km).

## 🆕 Run pace/HR, lifetime averages, run deletion — 2026-06-24

**[ADDED] avg_pace/avg_hr wired through properly, lifetime stats, and the ability to remove a logged run.**
- `log_run_to_shoe` (MCP) gained `avg_pace`/`avg_hr` params. New computed fields on
  `OwnedShoeResponse`: `lifetime_avg_pace`, `lifetime_avg_hr`, `total_runs`. Pace strings are
  averaged correctly — converted to seconds, averaged, formatted back (`_pace_to_seconds` /
  `_seconds_to_pace` in `routers/owned_shoes.py`). Computed by `_attach_computed_fields`, called
  from every owned_shoes endpoint that returns a shoe.
- **[ADDED]** `DELETE /api/owned-shoes/runs/{run_id}` — deletes the run and subtracts its
  `distance_km` back out of the parent shoe's `current_mileage` (floored at 0), returns the
  updated shoe. New MCP tool `delete_shoe_run(run_id)` mirrors it. Frontend: Trash icon per row
  with confirmation dialog. `useDeleteShoeRun` optimistically patches the cache in `onMutate`.

---

## 🆕 My Shoes UI polish — 2026-06-24

**[ADDED] Search, active/retired split, compact mileage text, and product images on owned shoe cards.**
- Renamed "Shoes" nav tab to **"Tracked Shoes"** to disambiguate from "My Shoes".
- My Shoes page has a client-side search bar and splits cards into **Active** and **Retired** sections.
- **Images on owned shoe cards**: priority is manual `image_url` (new nullable column on
  `owned_shoes`, migration `backend/migrate_add_owned_shoe_image.py`) → best-effort
  `matched_image_url` (heuristic join against `price_records.image_url` by brand/model substring)
  → placeholder. Never a broken `<img>`.

---

## 🆕 "My Shoes" personal rotation tracker — 2026-06-24

**[ADDED] Track owned shoes (mileage, notes, run history) — separate from deal tracking.**
- New tables `owned_shoes` + `shoe_runs` (`models.py`), created automatically by `init_db()`.
  Deliberately **not** the same table as `Shoe` (deal tracking).
- Backend: `app/routers/owned_shoes.py` — full CRUD + `POST /{id}/log-run` + `GET /{id}/runs`.
  `shoe_runs.source` is `"manual"` for now; `"coros"` is reserved for future COROS sync.
- MCP: 5 tools — `get_owned_shoes`, `get_shoe_runs`, `log_run_to_shoe`, `add_shoe_note`,
  `get_shoe_notes`, `delete_shoe_run`, `retire_shoe`.
- Frontend: `pages/MyShoes.jsx`, `OwnedShoeForm.jsx`, `LogRunDialog.jsx`,
  `MileageProgressBar.jsx` (green <500km / yellow 500–800km / red >800km).

## 🆕 Sporting Life investigated — blocked by Cloudflare — 2026-06-22

**[BLOCKED]** Sits behind a Cloudflare managed JS challenge — 403s plain requests AND headless
Playwright. Would need a paid proxy/unblocking service (ScraperAPI, Bright Data). Not added.

---

## 🆕 New retailer — En Route Run — 2026-06-22

**[ADDED] `EnRouteRunScraper`** (`app/scrapers/enroute_run.py`).
- Shopify-backed but headless Astro storefront — `/products.json`, `/products/<handle>.js`,
  `/search/suggest.json` all 404. Bespoke scraper parses inline Astro/Qwik hydration JSON
  (`_parse_variant_blocks()` unescapes HTML-entity-encoded variant data).
- Verified: Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 — genuine markdowns found end-to-end.

---

## 🆕 Phase 5 — 2026-06-18 (images, colorway consolidation, +3 retailers)

**Task 2 — Product images + colorway.**
- New nullable columns `image_url` + `colorway` on `price_records` and `deals`
  (migration `backend/migrate_add_images.py`).
- Algolia scrapers: image from S3 CDN URL, colorway from `thumbnails[].color_name`.
- Shopify scrapers: `image`/`featured_image`, protocol-relative normalized to `https:`,
  colorway from the Color option.

**Task 3 — Colorway consolidation UI.**
- `Deals.jsx` groups active deals by `shoe_id` — one card per model.
- `ShoeProductCard.jsx` + `ColorwaySelector.jsx` (thumbnail gallery switching active colorway).

**Task 1 — Automatic Algolia credential rediscovery.**
- `base_scraper.discover_algolia_credentials()` drives the site's own search with headless
  Playwright, intercepts `*.algolia.net` XHR to recover app id/key/index.
- `algolia_scraper._algolia_query` detects 401/403, rediscovers once per session, caches creds.

**Task 4 — +3 Shopify retailers.** Boutique Endurance, Le Coureur, BlackToe Running added.
