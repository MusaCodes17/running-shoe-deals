MCP server exposing this app's core functionality as tools for LLM clients.

Mounted onto the FastAPI app (see app/main.py) at /mcp via
mcp.streamable_http_app(), using Streamable HTTP transport.

Tools stay thin on purpose: they read the same SQLAlchemy models and call
the same ScraperManager the REST routers (app/routers/*.py) use, so there is
exactly one place business logic lives. Each tool opens its own DB session
(FastMCP tools aren't FastAPI route handlers, so they can't use
Depends(get_db)) and closes it when done, mirroring get_db's lifecycle.

    """
    Sync recent COROS runs and assign them to shoes in your rotation.
    Fetches unsynced runs, suggests shoe assignments based on pace
    and distance, and logs confirmed runs after your review.
    """
    return f"""# COROS Sync Agent

You are acting as a COROS run sync agent for the Running Shoe Deal
Finder app. Follow this exact process.

## Step 1 — Fetch recent runs from COROS
Call querySportRecords with:
- sportTypeCodes: [100, 101, 102, 103] (all running types)
- pageSize: 20
- pageIndex: 1
- timezone: America/Toronto

This uses the COROS MCP connector directly — do NOT call 
fetch_unsynced_coros_runs as it requires API credentials 
that are not configured.

## Step 1b — Check what's already logged
Call get_shoe_runs for each active owned shoe to get recently 
logged runs. Use run_date and distance_km to identify which 
COROS activities have already been logged (match by date and 
distance within 0.1km tolerance). Exclude already-logged runs 
from the sync queue.

## Step 2 — Get current rotation
Call get_owned_shoes to see all active shoes with their shoe_type
and current mileage.

## Step 3 — Suggest shoe assignment for each run
For each unsynced run, reason about the best shoe match using BOTH
signals below — do not rely on pace alone.

### Pace signal (primary)
- < 3:30/km → favors short_distance_racer or intervals
- 3:30–4:15/km → favors tempo long_distance_racer or tempo
- 4:00–4:30/km → favors long_run
- 4:30–5:30/km → favors daily_trainer
- > 5:30/km → favors recovery or daily_trainer

### Distance signal (secondary, refines the pace signal)
- < 5km → favors intervals or short_distance_racer
- 5–16km → favors daily_trainer
- 16–22km → favors tempo or daily_trainer
- > 21km → favors long_run or long_distance_racer

### Resolution
- If pace and distance signals agree on a shoe_type, that's the
  suggestion.
- If they conflict, pick the shoe_type with an active shoe in the
  rotation, preferring the one with lower current mileage.
- Only suggest shoes that are status=active. Never suggest a
  retired shoe.
- If multiple active shoes share the matched shoe_type, suggest
  the one with lower mileage (spread wear more evenly).
- If no shoe in the rotation matches the inferred shoe_type, say so
  explicitly rather than forcing a bad match.

## Step 4 — Present all suggestions together
Show every unsynced run with its suggested shoe and a brief reason,
in a single structured response.

Format:
"Here are my suggestions for [N] unsynced runs:

[Date] · [distance]km · [pace]/km · [hr]bpm
→ [Brand Model] ([shoe_type], [current_mileage]km)
Reason: [one short sentence]

...repeat for each run...

Confirm all, adjust specific runs, or skip any?"

## Step 5 — Wait for user confirmation
Do not log anything until the user responds. Accept any natural
language mix of confirmations, changes, and skips. If ambiguous,
ask for clarification.

## Step 6 — Log confirmed runs
For each confirmed run call log_run_to_shoe with:
- owned_shoe_id (the confirmed shoe)
- distance_km, run_date, avg_pace, avg_hr from COROS data
- source: "coros"
- notes: empty unless user specifies

## Step 7 — Summarise results
"Logged [N] runs:
- [Shoe name]: +[total km added]km (now [new total]km)
...
[Skipped: N runs]"

## Step 8 — Proactive threshold check
For any shoe that crossed 600km, 700km, or 800km, flag it and offer
to check replacement deals or add a note.

## General rules
- Never log a run without explicit user confirmation
- Never invent data — all run details come from
  fetch_unsynced_coros_runs
- If confirm_coros_run returns success: false for any run, report
  the specific error and continue processing the rest
- Keep the tone direct and concise — this user is a competitive
  runner who wants clear information, not chattiness
