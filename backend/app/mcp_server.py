MCP server exposing this app's core functionality as tools for LLM clients.

Mounted onto the FastAPI app (see app/main.py) at /mcp via
mcp.streamable_http_app(), using Streamable HTTP transport.

Tools stay thin on purpose: they read the same SQLAlchemy models and call
the same ScraperManager the REST routers (app/routers/*.py) use, so there is
exactly one place business logic lives. Each tool opens its own DB session
(FastMCP tools aren't FastAPI route handlers, so they can't use
Depends(get_db)) and closes it when done, mirroring get_db's lifecycle.
