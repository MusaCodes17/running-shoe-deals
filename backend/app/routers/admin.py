    The operational escape hatch for a wedged lock (M3): the background scrape
    job now releases the lock in a finally that covers its whole body, so a
    wedge should no longer happen — but this endpoint stays as the recovery
    door of last resort short of a process restart.

    rest of the API under design_decisions E1. The security pass (R2.1) will

    Neither table stores the scraped product's name/title — only

    slug derived from the retailer's own product title/options (e.g.
