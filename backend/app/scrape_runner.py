Background, concurrent (per-retailer) scrape job — the new flow behind
POST /api/scrape/all. Publishes progress to app.scrape_state for
GET /api/scrape/stream to relay as SSE.

The existing synchronous ScraperManager.scrape_shoe/scrape_all_shoes (used
by /api/scrape/shoe/{id}, /api/scrape/retailer/{id}, the MCP trigger_scrape
tool, and the chat assistant) are untouched — this is an additional, parallel
code path that reuses the same per-(shoe, retailer) primitive
(_scrape_retailer_for_shoe) rather than duplicating its logic.
