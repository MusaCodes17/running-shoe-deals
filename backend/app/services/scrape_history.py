"""
Scrape-health read model — the data behind Settings → Sync & Scraping's
per-retailer observability surface (R2.5).

Turns the durable `scrape_runs` telemetry (written by
`ScrapeOrchestrator.scrape_retailer` for full-catalog runs and
`ScrapeOrchestrator.scrape_shoe` for per-shoe syncs) into two answers:

- **health per retailer**: its latest run's outcome, distilled to one of
  `ok` / `warning` / `error` / `unknown`, plus a short recent-run trend.
  "warning" is the "quietly broken" case the whole feature exists for — a run
  that finished cleanly (`success`) but brought back zero products, which no
  error status would ever surface.
- **recent runs**: a flat, newest-first activity log across all retailers.

Read-only and derived-never-stored (CLAUDE.md §7): `health` is computed here at
read time, never persisted on the row. Personal scale (a dozen retailers, a
handful of runs each per scrape) makes the per-retailer "latest + last N" query
trivially cheap.
