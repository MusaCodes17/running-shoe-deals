# Anton — Product Roadmap

**Generated:** 2026-07-04. **Last updated:** 2026-07-09 (**RA — Remote Access & Deployment** added as the next milestone, prioritized ahead of R3 and R4, which are **parked**; RA pulls R5.2 forward and executes it. Plan doc: `REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md`. Prior update 2026-07-08: R2.7.1 Training Depth follow-ups.)
**Inputs:** REDESIGN_PLAN Phase-5 backlog, standing wishlist items recorded in `docs/changelog.md`, the ⚠️ verdicts in `docs/design_decisions.md`, `docs/architecture.md` §16, and user feature requests 2026-07-07.
**Framing:** Anton is evolving from a finished redesign into a long-term personal AI platform. This roadmap sequences that evolution.

**Naming note:** "Phase N" already means *redesign* phases in this repo's history (`p1:`…`p5:` commits). Roadmap phases are prefixed **R** (R1–R5) to avoid collision. Suggested commit prefix: `r2:` etc.

**Complexity scale:** **Low** = within one session · **Medium** = 1–3 sessions · **High** = multi-session, deserves its own §-numbered plan doc first.
**Standing rule inherited from the redesign:** backend + tests before UI; suite green + changelog entry per session; the confirmation-gate posture (design_decisions C9) applies to every agent below.

## R1 — Immediate Priorities

*Close the loose ends the redesign and today's migration left behind. Everything here is small, and everything after benefits.*

| # | Item | Description | Why it matters | Dependencies | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1.1 | **Commit & finish the documentation program** | ✅ **Done 2026-07-06** (documentation-completion session): the suite + `refactoring/` + `CLAUDE.md` + the rename committed as `docs: complete Phase 1 documentation program`; same session added CLAUDE.md §14 (INVARIANTS) and implemented `.claude/skills/` (13 files). Row moved to project_state §3. | Every future AI session boots on these files; uncommitted docs are one `git clean` from gone. | none | Low |
| R1.2 | **Prune the stale reference sections in `docs/changelog.md`** | ✅ **Done 2026-07-06** (docs-reconciliation session): tail replaced with a pointer into `docs/`; the Retailer Status table was relocated to `architecture.md` §10 first; header retitled. Changelog entries above were untouched. | The changelog is the most-read file in the repo; wrong reference material there actively misleads new sessions. | none | Low |
| R1.3 | **Wire the Replacement Deals card on `/shoes/:id`** | ✅ **Done** (the live section shipped in PR #9; size availability added 2026-07-07, R1.3 — see project_state §3 and changelog 2026-07-07). Same-type active deals, worst-discount-first, brand/model/retailer/price/savings/sizes/link, with loading/error/empty/no-type states. | Closes the oldest visible loose end; makes the cross-domain bridge useful exactly where retirement decisions happen. | none (data exists) | Low |
| R1.4 | **Guard the `ShoeRun` proxy traps** | ✅ **Done 2026-07-07** (Session B): `contains_eager(ShoeRun.activity)` added to all five run-list seams; model WARNING comment added; no proxy `.filter()` misuse found. Row → project_state §3. | Today's migration left exactly one loaded gun for future code (N+1 + silently-broken filters). Cheapest possible insurance, best done while fresh. | none | Low |
| R1.5 | **Debt sweep #1** | ✅ **Done 2026-07-07** (Session B, four commits): (a) Task D — `rotation.attach_computed_fields`, router→router import gone; (b) `scraper_manager` shim deleted (5 consumers); (c) pure `app/utils/pace.py` (3 copies collapsed); (d) `chat_service.MODELS` single-sources the catalog + id-based provider routing. Row → project_state §3. | Clears every ⚠ flag in the dependency graph except fat routers; each item is small but they compound into real drift risk if left. | none | Low–Medium (one session, four commits) |
| R1.6 | **Decide APScheduler** | ✅ **Done 2026-07-07** (Session B): removed from `requirements.txt` (default outcome); scheduling note added to `scrapers/lock.py`; E5 → Superseded. Reinstate only with an R4.1 design. Row → project_state §3. | A dependency without an architecture invites drive-by wiring that would collide with the single-process scrape lock. | none | Low |

**All of R1 is complete (2026-07-07). R2.1 then shipped 2026-07-07.** Next in R2: R2.2 schema authority, then R2.7 training depth.

---

## R2 — Core Platform

*Turn "works on my machine, trusted LAN" into a platform that can safely grow interfaces. R2 is the gate in front of R3–R5.*

| # | Item | Description | Why it matters | Dependencies | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R2.1 | **Security pass** ✅ **Done (2026-07-07)** | Shared bearer token enforced on `/api` and `/mcp` (Claude Desktop's `mcp-remote --header` and `chat_service`'s loopback client both send it); default bind to `127.0.0.1`, `API_HOST=0.0.0.0` the explicit LAN opt-in. **Shipped**: pure-ASGI middleware, fail-fast on missing secret, SPA `VITE_ANTON_SECRET`, 13 HTTP-layer tests (E1 → E7). *Rate limiting on `/api/chat/message` was split out as a separate R2 item* (plan §6) — not part of R2.1. | The acknowledged precondition for *everything* exposure-increasing (agents unattended, mobile, remote MCP). Converts the trust model from network posture to application property. | none — do first in R2 | Medium |
| R2.2 | **Schema authority resolution** | Alembic becomes the sole schema source: `create_all` demoted to test fixtures; `legacy_migrations/` archived; live DB + `.bak*` files relocated out of the tree (e.g. `~/anton-data/`) with a dated-backup convention; `DATABASE_URL` already supports the move. | Ends the "model edit without migration silently diverges" trap and the five-backups-next-to-source ambiguity. Prerequisite hygiene for every future migration. | R1.1 (docs committed) | Medium |
| R2.3 | **Indexed read paths over the canonical table** ✅ **Done (2026-07-08, Session I)** | Shipped: `unified_activities` now issues one indexed SQL query (all filters + newest-first order + LIMIT/OFFSET pushed to the DB) behind the unchanged seam, served by the new composite index `ix_activities_type_run_date` (migration `b8c9d0e1f2a3`); `services/watchlist.py` extracted from the fat router (thin adapter + value-object dataclasses). Suite 127 → 128. See project_state §3 and changelog 2026-07-08. | R1.4 (eager-loading conventions set) | Medium |
| R2.4 | **Shoe-type controlled vocabulary** ✅ **Done (2026-07-08, Session K)** | Shipped: `app/utils/shoe_types.py` owns the vocabulary, served at `GET /api/shoe-types`, validated on the write schemas (422 on off-vocab); the frontend `lib/shoeTypes.js` copy is deleted (reduced to presentation-only colours + a title-case formatter, fetching via `useShoeTypes()`). Migration `c9d0e1f2a3b4` normalized 9 legacy `owned_shoes` free-text values (E4-reconciled). Suite 133 → 141. See project_state §3 and changelog 2026-07-08. | none | Low–Medium |
| R2.5 | **Scrape observability** | Persist scrape runs/attempts (per retailer: started, finished, product count, error) written by the orchestrator; surface per-retailer health + trend in Settings → Sync & Scraping. | "Is Altitude quietly broken?" becomes a query instead of log archaeology. The substrate R4.1 (scheduling) and R4.5 (watchdog) require. Forces the documented decision on the single-process lock. | none | Medium |
| R2.6 | **Server-side conversation & memory persistence** | Move Son of Anton conversations (and checkpoint-prompt state) from localStorage into the backend (tables + endpoints), keeping the client stateless-per-request contract. | Device-bound memory contradicts the API-first multi-client principle; agents (R3) need shared context; quota-trimming currently discards history silently. Scheduled-to-change in design_decisions C8. | R2.1 (chat endpoints stop being anonymous) | Medium |
| R2.7 | **Training & Activity Depth** ✅ **Done (2026-07-08)** | A self-contained milestone adding richer per-activity data, smarter records, athlete-level fitness metrics, and activity editing. Eight sub-items (T1–T8) ordered internally by dependency — schema foundation first, then services, then UI. **All shipped across Sessions F/G/H — see §R2.7 and project_state §3.** | Turns the Training tab from a volume tracker into a genuine training log; makes the records card trustworthy; surfaces COROS athlete metrics the platform already fetches but discards. | R2.2 (migration hygiene before schema changes); internal sub-item dependencies noted in §R2.7 | Medium–High (write `TRAINING_DEPTH_PLAN.md` before executing) |

**Order within R2:** 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4 → 2.5 → 2.6 → 2.7. (Security first; schema hygiene before anything that adds tables — 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 all add columns/tables and should be born as clean migrations. R2.7 can run in parallel with 2.3–2.6 once 2.2 is done.)

---

## §R2.7 — Training & Activity Depth (detailed breakdown)

*Eight sub-items from user feature requests (2026-07-07). `TRAINING_DEPTH_PLAN.md` (repo root) is the executing contract — this milestone touches the canonical `Activity` table and the PB algorithm, both of which require the E4 migration discipline.*

**Internal dependency order: T1 → T2 → T3 (schema foundation), then T4/T5/T6 in parallel, then T7, then T8.**

**Progress:** ✅ **Complete — all eight sub-items T1–T8 (Sessions 1–3, F/G/H).** Session 1 (2026-07-07, F): T1 tag vocabulary + 4 `activities` columns (migration `e5f6a7b8c9d0`), T2 COROS field population, T3 PB eligibility fix. Session 2 (2026-07-08, G): T4a month volume axis, T4b date-range picker (backend `date_from`/`date_to` + UI), T5 `athlete_metrics` table + fitness card (migration `f6a7b8c9d0e1`), T6 `/activities/:id` edit + shoe reassignment (INV-1 ledger) + race promotion. Session 3 (2026-07-08, H): T7 `planned_races.activity_id` FK (migration `a7b8c9d0e1f2`, set by the T6 promote flow, deep-links past-race rows) · T8 `suggest_tag_from_name` + `sync_coros_runs` prompt extension (suggestion only, C9). See changelog and project_state §3. **Follow-ups from testing: see §R2.7.1 below (F1–F4) — T2 field population, volume reconciliation, T5 fitness wiring, and the Training-tab 2×2 grid.**

### T1 — Extend the Activity model

**What:** Add nullable columns to `activities` via a reversible Alembic migration:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `activity_tag` | `String(30)` | Controlled vocabulary (see below); nullable — existing rows untagged |
| `best_km_pace_s` | `Integer` | Best consecutive-km pace within the activity (s/km); null if < 1 km |
| `training_load` | `Float` | COROS training load score if available; null otherwise |
| `training_focus` | `String(50)` | Coaching label (e.g. "Aerobic base", "Lactate threshold") — from COROS or manual |

Note: `elapsed_time_s` already exists on the `Activity` model — verify it is being populated by the COROS sync path before T2.

**`activity_tag` controlled vocabulary** (served by the backend — same pattern as R2.4 shoe-type):
`Easy` · `Long Run` · `Recovery` · `Tempo` · `Intervals` · `Track` · `Workout` · `Trail` · `Parkrun` · `Race`

Tag is user-set or inferred from COROS activity name heuristics at sync time (T8). It is the governing input for PB eligibility (T3), race promotion (T6), and the weekly summary agent (R3.1). Treat vocabulary edits as schema-grade changes — the list must not grow casually.

**Migration discipline:** follow E4 (reversible downgrade, named backup, pre/post reconciliation). These are purely additive nullable columns — downgrade simply drops them. Low risk, but the discipline is non-negotiable.

### T2 — COROS sync field population

**What:** Update the COROS confirm-and-log path (`services/coros.py` + `mcp_server.confirm_coros_run`) to populate the fields the COROS API returns but the current sync discards: `name`, `elevation_gain_m`, `moving_time_s`, `elapsed_time_s`, `avg_cadence`, `calories`, `training_load`, `training_focus`.

**Confirmation protocol extension (C9 compliance):** When a COROS field can't be cleanly mapped to Anton's vocabulary (e.g. COROS proprietary training-load scale, or a `training_focus` label that doesn't match Anton's vocabulary), surface the best-guess value in the sync confirmation step alongside the shoe suggestion — *"COROS labels this 'Marathon Pace', mapping to tag `Tempo` — correct?"* The runner confirms or overrides; sync never silently assumes. This extends the existing `sync_coros_runs` MCP prompt's confirmation table.

**Dependency:** T1 (columns must exist before they can be written).

### T3 — Records algorithm fix

**The problem:** The current PB algorithm uses average pace over a whole activity within a distance band. A session of 1 km intervals with full-stop rests between them can match a 5 km race distance at interval pace — producing a false "5k record."

**Recommended approach — tag-based exclusion (primary) + elapsed-time guard (secondary):**

Primary filter — exclude by tag:
- `Intervals` and `Track` → always excluded from PB calculations
- `Race` and `Parkrun` → always included
- `Easy`, `Long Run`, `Recovery`, `Tempo`, `Trail`, `Workout` → included (a slow long run won't break a 5k PB; if a tempo run does, it's legitimate)
- Untagged activities → apply the elapsed-time guard below

Secondary filter — elapsed-time guard for untagged activities:
- If `elapsed_time_s > 1.5 × moving_time_s` → flag as suspicious, exclude from PB, surface a `pbs_excluded_reason` field in the response so the UI can show "N activities excluded — tag them to reconsider"

**Why not elapsed-time-only:** elapsed ≈ moving for both an easy 5k and a race 5k; the ratio only catches stop-heavy sessions. The tag is the clean intentional signal; the ratio is the right fallback for untagged history (including the 8-year Strava archive).

**Implementation:** update `services/strava_stats.py` PB query to join `Activity.activity_tag` and apply the exclusion filters. Add `pbs_excluded_count` and `pbs_excluded_reason` to the PB response for transparency.

**Dependency:** T1 (tag column must exist); T2 (to populate tags on new COROS activities going forward).

### T4 — Training tab display improvements

Two independent UI changes, committable separately. No schema dependency — verify the backend params noted below.

**T4a — Months instead of week numbers:** Replace week-number axis labels on the mileage/volume chart with month labels ("Jun", "Jul"). The underlying data stays weekly — this is a display/axis-formatting change only. No backend change required.

**T4b — Date range selection:** Add a date-range picker to the Training tab header controlling the activities list, volume chart, and summary card. `/api/activities` already accepts `date_from`/`date_to` params. Verify `/api/training/summary` does too — add them if not. Default range: last 90 days (preserving current implicit behaviour). Persist selection in React state only (resets on navigation — intentional).

### T5 — Athlete fitness metrics

**What:** A new table `athlete_metrics` storing periodic COROS athlete-level snapshots — not per-activity, but per-sync:

| Field | Type | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer PK | — | |
| `vo2max` | Float | COROS API | ml/kg/min |
| `threshold_pace_s_per_km` | Integer | COROS API | Lactate threshold pace |
| `race_predictions` | JSON | COROS API | `{"5.0": 1234, "10.0": 2468, ...}` — distance_km → predicted_time_s |
| `captured_at` | DateTime | server | When this snapshot was taken |

A new card on the Training tab (alongside Records and Races) shows the most recent snapshot: VO2 Max, threshold pace formatted as "M:SS/km", and race predictions across standard distances (5k, 10k, HM, marathon). Refreshed on each COROS sync.

**COROS API coverage:** Before planning the sync implementation, verify which COROS Open-API endpoint exposes these fields — include a discovery step in `TRAINING_DEPTH_PLAN.md`. If the server-side `coros_client` path cannot access them (credential restriction), extend the `sync_coros_runs` Claude Desktop agent prompt to fetch and confirm them alongside runs.

**Dependency:** T1 (Activity schema stable before adding new tables); T2 (establishes the COROS field-mapping pattern).

### T6 — Activity edit & open

**What:** An activity detail view (slide-over panel or `/activities/:id` page) enabling:
1. View all activity fields (distance, pace, HR, elevation, tag, notes, shoe)
2. Edit: `activity_tag` (dropdown from T1 vocabulary), `name`, `description`/notes, and shoe attribution via a shoe-picker
3. **Promote to race:** when tag is set to `Race`, offer "Add to races" — pre-fills a `PlannedRace` row with the activity's date, distance, and time as the result with status `completed`. This is the workflow for "I ran a race and want it in the races dashboard."

**New service function:** `rotation.reassign_attribution(db, activity_id, new_shoe_id)` — removes the existing `ShoeRun`, decrements the old shoe's mileage counter, increments the new shoe's, creates the new `ShoeRun`. This must flow through the mileage ledger invariant (INV-1), not a raw ORM update.

**New endpoint:** `PATCH /api/activities/{id}` — accepts partial updates to tag, name, description; shoe reassignment goes to a separate sub-endpoint `POST /api/activities/{id}/reassign-shoe` (write semantics differ).

**Dependency:** T1 (tag field must exist); T3 (tag drives PB re-evaluation after an edit changes a tag).

### T7 — Past race → activity link

**What:** Add `activity_id` (nullable FK → `activities.id`) to `planned_races`. When a `PlannedRace` is marked `completed`, link it to the `Activity` that was the race. Past-race rows on the Races card become tappable links opening the T6 activity detail view with full stats. The T6 "promote to race" flow sets this FK automatically.

**Migration:** additive nullable FK column — low-risk, reversible downgrade drops the column.

**Dependency:** T6 (the activity detail view it links to).

### T8 — Activity tag inference from COROS name

**What:** When COROS sync populates `Activity.name` (T2), apply a simple heuristic to *suggest* an `activity_tag` at confirmation time rather than leaving it blank:

| COROS name pattern (case-insensitive) | Suggested tag |
|---|---|
| Contains "interval", "repeat" | `Intervals` |
| Contains "long run", "long" | `Long Run` |
| Contains "tempo", "threshold" | `Tempo` |
| Contains "race", "marathon" | `Race` |
| Contains "parkrun" | `Parkrun` |
| Contains "recovery", "easy", "jog" | `Recovery` or `Easy` |
| Contains "trail" | `Trail` |
| Contains "track" | `Track` |
| No match | untagged — user sets manually |

The suggested tag appears in the COROS sync confirmation table. The runner confirms or overrides — heuristics are never auto-applied silently (C9). Implementation is a pure extension of the `sync_coros_runs` MCP prompt text plus a small helper function; no new backend endpoints.

**Dependency:** T2 (name field populated at sync time); T1 (tag field exists to receive the value).

## §R2.7.1 — Training Depth follow-ups (bug-fix pass, pre-R3) ✅ Done — Session Q, 2026-07-08

*Four gaps surfaced by hands-on testing after R2.7 was marked complete (2026-07-08). Small, self-contained; finishes the training milestone honestly before R3. Decisions locked with the runner: rolling-365-day volume window · 2×2 = Races/Records/Fitness/Predictions · dedicated `sync_fitness` prompt + new `running_level` field. Migration `f2a3b4c5d6e7`. Suite 185 → 188.*

**All four items shipped: F1 → F2 → F3 → F4.**

### F1 — Finish COROS + manual run field population (closes T2 for real)

The COROS *write* path (`confirm_coros_run` → `coros.confirm_run` → `rotation.log_run`) already persists all rich fields, but in practice elevation/times/cadence/calories/load/focus land NULL because the `sync_coros_runs` prompt fetches only `querySportRecords` (which doesn't return them) and never calls `getActivityDetail`. `log_run_to_shoe` lacks the rich params entirely.

- Update the `sync_coros_runs` MCP prompt to call the COROS `getActivityDetail(labelId, sportType)` per confirmed run and pass elevation/moving/elapsed/cadence/calories into `confirm_coros_run` (C9-gated, no silent behavior).
- Add the same optional rich params (+ `activity_tag`, validated) to `log_run_to_shoe` and forward to `rotation.log_run` (already supports them).
- Out of scope: the narrow REST manual path (`ShoeRunCreate`/`CorosAssignment`) — flagged as a known parity gap.
- Test: `rotation.log_run` persists the rich fields at the service chokepoint.

### F2 — Reconcile the 12-month volume figures

The "Last 12 mo" stat tile (12 calendar-month buckets, `Math.round`) and the Volume header total (rolling-365-day range, `.toFixed(1)`) disagree by window boundary + rounding. Fix (frontend `Training.jsx` only): compute the tile from a fixed **trailing-365-day** query and unify rounding, so it equals the header total when the `1y` preset is selected. No backend change (`/api/training/summary` already takes `date_from`/`date_to`).

### F3 — Fitness metrics: populate T5 end-to-end + running level

The `athlete_metrics` table, `record_athlete_metrics` tool, `GET /fitness` endpoint, and `FitnessCard` all exist, but nothing orchestrates the COROS fetch, so no snapshot is ever recorded and the card stays hidden.

- Add nullable `running_level` (Float) to `AthleteMetric` (reversible E4 migration off `a7b8c9d0e1f2`); thread it through `services/fitness`, `FitnessResponse`, and `record_athlete_metrics`.
- New `sync_fitness` MCP prompt (sibling of `sync_coros_runs`): calls COROS `queryFitnessAssessmentOverview`, confirms with the runner (C9), then `record_athlete_metrics` (VO2max, threshold pace, race predictions, running level).
- Test: `running_level` round-trips through service + endpoint; empty envelope still `has_data=False`.

### F4 — Training tab 2×2 card grid

Replace the full-width vertical stack of Fitness/Races/Records with a `grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 lg:grid-cols-2` of four cards: **Races · Records · Fitness · Predictions**. Extract race predictions out of `FitnessCard` into a new `PredictionsCard`; wrap the inline Records grid in a new `RecordsCard` using the standard outer-card shell. The stat strip + Volume chart stay full-width above; the Activities list stays full-width below. Cards stack to one column on mobile.

**Dependency:** F4's PredictionsCard/Fitness split pairs with F3's card content, but the layout work is otherwise independent.

## RA — Remote Access & Deployment *(added 2026-07-09 — executes before R3/R4)*

*Turn "reachable on my laptop at home" into "reachable from Claude mobile anywhere." RA pulls **R5.2** forward and executes it. Phase 1 (RA1) is backend-only — the DB + MCP on an always-on host so `sync_coros_runs` works from a phone on cellular; remote/mobile *clients* are RA2 and later R5.1. **`REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md` is the executing contract** — threat-model shift, hosting decision D0, spikes S1–S3, sequencing, cutover runbook, and the invariants checklist all live there; this table is the index.*

*Two facts shape RA1 (plan §2): Claude mobile connectors are called from **Anthropic's cloud**, so the MCP endpoint must be publicly resolvable over HTTPS — a Tailscale-into-the-LAN overlay does not satisfy the goal; and the laptop sleeps, so serving moves to an always-on host (cloud VM recommended, always-on home box the fallback — decision gate D0). A1 (local-first) is amended, not abandoned: local-first stays the dev posture; serving becomes hosted single-tenant.*

| # | Item | Description | Why it matters | Dependencies | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RA1.0 | **Hosting decision (D0) + discovery spikes (S1–S3)** ✅ **Done (2026-07-09)** | S1: connector requires OAuth or capability-URL (bearer not supported — #112/#411 closed); S2: mobile prompt invocability unconfirmed, C6 fallback documented; S3: existing ASGI middleware sufficient, full OAuth deferred. D0: Option A cloud VM (Hetzner/Fly.io ~$5–8 CAD/mo; always-on home box = escape hatch for DC-IP scrape degradation). Findings in `REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md` §4–§5; A1 amended in design_decisions.md. | Every subsequent item's design branches on these answers; doing them first is the difference between a plan and a rewrite. | none | Low (research) |
| RA1.1 | **Auth v2 — per-client, connector-compatible tokens** ✅ **Done (2026-07-09)** | Named `ANTON_TOKENS="name:token,..."` map (desktop/loopback/spa); capability-URL bypass at `/mcp/<CONNECTOR_TOKEN>/...` (path-rewritten in ASGI middleware); constant-time multi-token OR comparison; `get_named_token("loopback")` for chat_service; `ANTON_SECRET` rotated. `test_auth.py` rewritten +8 tests; `test_http_smoke.py` updated for shared env setup. Suite 188 → 196. E7 → Superseded by E9. | E7's shared cleartext token was designed for a trusted LAN; the internet threat model (plan §3) requires TLS-only transport, revocation per client, and visible failures. The mobile connector literally cannot connect until this exists. | RA1.0 | Medium (High if OAuth path) |
| RA1.1b | **OAuth 2.1 upgrade for the connector (pre-public gate)** ✅ **Done (2026-07-09)** | **Path 1 chosen** — `mcp[cli]` 1.28 has `OAuthAuthorizationServerProvider` Protocol + `create_auth_routes()` (4 endpoints). Built: `AntonOAuthProvider` (9 async methods), `oauth_auth_codes` + `oauth_tokens` tables (migration `0b1c2d3e4f5a`), `GET/POST /oauth/login` page, middleware OAuth fallback. Capability-URL **deleted** (never went public). 18 new tests; suite 194 → 210. E9 updated; capability-URL → Superseded. | The URL-as-credential leaks into every log line, and the connector is the primary long-term consumer — build its real auth once if the SDK makes it contained. | RA1.1; **decide before RA1.5** | Medium–High (OAuth) / Low (keep fallback + redaction) |
| RA1.2 | **Deployment substrate** ✅ **Done (2026-07-09)** | `backend/Dockerfile` (Python 3.11-slim + `playwright install --with-deps chromium` + `TZ=America/Toronto` + `--workers 1`); `backend/.dockerignore`; `docker-compose.yml` (loopback-only port + `~/anton-data` volume + healthcheck); `deploy/Caddyfile` (Let's Encrypt TLS + `flush_interval -1` unbuffered streaming + credential-redacting log filter); `deploy/.env.production.example`; **INV-9** added to CLAUDE.md §14. Remaining acceptance (deployed HTTPS + streaming verified through proxy) = human steps at RA1.5. | The always-on host is the whole point of phase 1; the one-worker pin keeps two load-bearing in-process invariants true by construction rather than by luck. | RA1.0 | Medium |
| RA1.3 | **Surface & abuse hardening** ✅ **Done (2026-07-09)** | `AccessLogMiddleware` (structured per-request log + credential redaction); per-IP auth-failure rate limiter (429 after burst; `AUTH_FAILURE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` env); 401 logged at WARNING with source IP; login-page rate limiter (`LOGIN_FAILURE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` env); Caddyfile comment updated. Suite 210 → 231. Remaining human step: uptime pinger on `/health` (execute at RA1.5). | An internet-facing service gets scanned within minutes of DNS propagating; the goal is that hostile traffic is slow and visible, not invisible. | RA1.2 | Low–Medium |
| RA1.4 | **Backups off-laptop** ✅ **Code done (2026-07-09); restore drill = human step** | Litestream config (`backend/litestream.yml`; B2/S3-compatible; 14-day WAL retention + daily snapshots); `backend/entrypoint.sh` (restore-on-start + replicate-while-running; plain uvicorn without `LITESTREAM_BUCKET`); Dockerfile installs Litestream v0.3.13 + sqlite3 CLI + switches CMD; `deploy/restore.sh` (drill + disaster recovery); `deploy/pull-snapshot.sh` (laptop dev-DB seed). Human steps at RA1.5: provision B2 bucket + set vars; run `deploy/restore.sh` to scratch path + verify counts; pull snapshot; uptime pinger. | The recovery story today is file copies on a laptop that will no longer hold the live DB. A backup that has never been restored is a hope. | RA1.2 | Low–Medium |
| RA1.5 | **Cutover & validation** | Execute the plan §7 runbook: E4-style count reconciliation across the DB move, re-point Claude Desktop, add the claude.ai connector. Two exit criteria: (1) **end-to-end mobile sync on cellular** — COROS fetch → suggest → confirm → run lands with rich fields and mileage updates; (2) **the DC-IP scrape checkpoint** — full scrape from the new host compared per-retailer against the home baseline via R2.5 `scrape_runs`; material degradation invokes the home-box escape hatch (no paid-bypass escalation, D3 stands). | The milestone's definition of done is the user story itself, plus proof the deals domain didn't quietly pay for it. | RA1.1–RA1.4 | Medium |
| RA1.6 | **Docs reconciliation** | `architecture.md` §11 rewritten for the internet trust model; design_decisions: A1 amended (hosted serving, local dev), E7 → per-client tokens, D0 recorded with rejected alternatives; R5.2 closed as pulled-forward-and-executed; `CLAUDE.md` INV-9; `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md` remote URL. | A fresh session reading `docs/` must describe the deployed reality, not the laptop. | RA1.5 | Low |
| RA2 | **Remote clients (deferred sketch)** | SPA served remotely behind real session auth (login + httpOnly cookie — the baked bundle secret dies), then a PWA pass (manifest + installable + the existing 380 px discipline) as the interim mobile UI, then R5.1 native. Plan §8. | The stepping stones from "backend reachable" to "the app in my pocket," sequenced so each step is useful on its own. | RA1; precedes/accompanies R5.1 | Medium–High (own plan doc when scheduled) |

**Order within RA:** 1.0 → 1.1 → (1.1b ∥ 1.2) → 1.3 + 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.6, with **1.1b decided before 1.5** — the connector's public auth mechanism must be settled before the endpoint exists in public DNS. **Auth v2 and TLS land together or not at all** — a public bind with a single shared cleartext token is a regression, not an intermediate state. RA2 is not scheduled; it waits for RA1 to prove the substrate.

## R3 — AI Capabilities *(⏸ parked 2026-07-09 — resumes after RA1; see `REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md`)*

*The redesign built the surfaces; R3 populates them. Every agent obeys C9: prepare and propose, the runner disposes. **Parked in favor of RA:** remote reachability is worth more right now than proactive agents — and R3 agents built after RA1 inherit the remote substrate (an agent digest readable from a phone anywhere beats one readable only at home).*

| # | Item | Description | Why it matters | Dependencies | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R3.1 | **Weekly Rotation Summary Agent** ✅ **Done (2026-07-10)** | Shipped: `services/weekly_summary.py` compiles the ISO-week digest (volume vs last week, per-shoe usage + shoe_type, retirement pipeline, notable runs tagged Race/Parkrun/Intervals/Tempo/Long Run/Track, 100km checkpoints, next race). `get_weekly_summary` MCP tool + `weekly_rotation_summary` MCP prompt (read-only sibling of `sync_coros_runs`). 20 new tests. Suite 231 → 253. | The first *proactive* value from the AI layer, built almost entirely from existing tools (`get_training_summary`, `retirement_pipeline`, `get_shoe_runs`). Proves the agent pattern cheaply. R2.7 T1 activity tags make "notable runs" (`Race`, `Tempo`) identifiable. | none hard; R2.6 makes digests persistent; R2.7 T1 enriches "notable runs" | Medium |
| R3.2 | **Deal Alert Agent** | Detection + digest for deal *events*: new qualified deal on a tracked shoe, price-drop on an active deal, replacement-deal appearing for a pipeline shoe. On-demand/"since last check" first (persisted high-water mark); push delivery arrives with R4.2. | The deals domain's whole purpose is timely opportunity — today it requires opening the app. Backlog item; Home top-deals module is its surface. | R2.5 helps (event source); delivery beyond in-app needs R3.5 | Medium |
| R3.3 | **Shoe review pipeline maturation** | Grow `draft_shoe_review` (MCP sampling) into a workflow: retirement → prompt to review → draft from the notes journal → runner edits → stored on the shoe (and exportable). | The notes journal exists to feed this; retirement is its natural trigger; it's the payoff of the mileage-anchored journaling discipline. | R1.3 pattern (detail-page work); storage column | Low–Medium |
| R3.4 | **MCP watchlist parity + resource expansion** | Expose the watchlist through MCP (tool + resource) once R2.3 extracts the service; add `training://fitness` resource (R2.7 T5 athlete metrics) for chat pre-priming alongside `training://summary`. | Son of Anton currently can't answer "what am I watching and what's the best price ever?" — the only major read surface missing from the AI layer. | R2.3; R2.7 T5 for fitness resource | Low |
| R3.5 | **Notification channel (Email MCP or equivalent)** | One outbound channel for agent output — the explored Email MCP, or the simplest reliable alternative (e.g. a digest endpoint the phone reads). Decide once, use for R3.1/R3.2/R4.5. | Agents that can only speak when spoken to aren't agents. Channel choice is a one-time decision every proactive feature reuses. | R2.1 (an authenticated system shouldn't email from an open one) | Medium |
| R3.6 | **Race-block training advisor** | A prompt-encoded advisor over existing data: weeks-to-race (planned_races), recent volume/paces (training summary), rotation state, VO2 Max + threshold pace (R2.7 T5) — producing block-level observations ("9 weeks out, volume trailing your Ottawa build; threshold pace suggests 3:43/km target pace"). Advisory text only; no plan-generation pretensions. | Highest-value reasoning use of data already collected; zero new schema. The runner's actual use case (sub-2:37 target). R2.7 T5 makes this considerably richer. | R3.1 (shares digest machinery); R2.7 T5 (fitness metrics) | Medium |

**Order within R3:** 3.1 → 3.4 → 3.3 → 3.2 → 3.5 → 3.6.

## R4 — Automation *(⏸ parked 2026-07-09 — resumes after RA1, behind R3)*

*Remove the human trigger where — and only where — the human isn't the point. Confirmation gates on writes remain non-negotiable. **Parked with R3:** additionally, R4.1's scheduled scraping is better designed once RA1 has settled where the process actually runs (an always-on host makes scheduling more natural, and the DC-IP scrape validation in RA1.5 informs it).*

| # | Item | Description | Why it matters | Dependencies | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R4.1 | **Scheduled scraping** | Nightly (or N-hourly) scrape runs via a real design: persisted job state, DB-level or documented single-process coordination replacing the bare in-memory lock, per-retailer staggering, failure recording into R2.5's tables. This is where APScheduler earns re-admission (R1.6). | Deal data is only as good as its freshness; manual triggering is the platform's biggest remaining chore. | R2.5 (observability), R1.6 decision; R2.1 before exposing any trigger surface | Medium–High |
| R4.2 | **Agent scheduling & event delivery** | Weekly summary auto-runs Monday morning; deal alerts fire on new-deal events from scheduled scrapes; both deliver via R3.5's channel. | Turns R3's on-demand agents into ambient value — Anton starts *telling* the runner things. | R3.1, R3.2, R3.5, R4.1 | Medium |
| R4.3 | **Semi-automated COROS cadence** | Within the Claude-Desktop-mediated constraint (design_decisions C6): a "runs pending sync" nudge (Home strip already shows last-sync) + one-tap launch of the `sync_coros_runs` flow. Full automation is *not* possible while COROS OAuth is desktop-managed — design to the constraint, don't fight it. | Sync friction is the main data-freshness gap on the training side. | R3.5 (nudge channel) | Low–Medium |
| R4.4 | **Coupon Hunting Agent** | Periodic promo-code discovery beyond the current homepage regex: agent-driven checks of retailer promo pages, validated codes landing in `promo_codes` (source=`scraped`; manual still wins). Explored-and-deferred wishlist item. | Stacking a promo on a qualified deal is real money; currently ad-hoc. | R4.1 (scheduler), scraper heuristics | Medium |
| R4.5 | **Scraper watchdog** | Trend rules over R2.5 data: "retailer X has returned 0 products for 3 runs" → alert via R3.5. | Silent scraper death is the current failure mode (visible only in logs); the deal feed degrades invisibly. | R2.5, R3.5, R4.1 | Low |

**Order within R4:** 4.1 → 4.5 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4.

## R5 — Long-Term Vision

*Anton as a durable personal platform: reachable anywhere, ingesting everything relevant, reasoning across a decade of data. Everything here deserves its own plan doc before code.*

| # | Item | Description | Why it matters | Dependencies | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R5.1 | **Native mobile client** | The long-anticipated app: Home as launch screen (built to budget for this), log-run + sync-nudge + deal alerts as the core loop. Precede with a typed/generated API contract (OpenAPI client) — the moment a second consumer exists, hand-matched string contracts stop scaling (design_decisions A5's named trigger). | The platform's stated destination; every API-first discipline since Phase 1 was bought for this. | R2.1 (hard gate), R2.6, R3.5; contract-generation spike | High |
| R5.2 | **Remote access story** | **→ Pulled forward (2026-07-09): executed by RA1** — see `REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md`. The original question (private overlay vs hosted) is answered there with a decisive fact: Claude connectors call from Anthropic's cloud, so a public HTTPS endpoint is required, and an overlay alone can't deliver the mobile-sync goal. The remote-MCP-for-ChatGPT transport remains deferred; revisit after RA1. | Mobile off-WiFi and any third-party MCP client both need this answered; it's a security-architecture decision, not a feature. | R2.1, R2.2 → superseded by RA1 | (absorbed into RA1) |
| R5.3 | **Purchase-loop closure** | Optional provenance from deal → owned shoe: "I bought this" on a deal creates/links an owned shoe with purchase price pre-filled. Must respect B1 (wanting ≠ owning): an *optional recorded event*, never a forced workflow or FK entanglement. | Closes the platform's narrative loop (watch → buy → run → retire → replace) and feeds real cost/km from day one. | R2.4 (shared vocabulary) | Medium |
| R5.4 | **Richer ingestion** | Candidates, each its own decision: per-run FIT-file detail (COROS MCP already exposes FIT downloads) for splits/HR curves; periodic Strava re-exports folded in via the existing idempotent importer; weather-at-run enrichment. Gate each on a question it answers, not on data availability. R2.7 T1 columns provide natural landing spots for split data. | The canonical `activities` table is deliberately a superset schema — it can absorb richer data without restructuring. | R2.3; per-source spikes | High (aggregate) |
| R5.5 | **Longitudinal analytics** | The decade-scale questions: shoe-model performance correlations (pace/HR by shoe across years), wear-rate curves by type, injury-pattern context (the recurring left-leg history) annotated against volume spikes. R2.7 activity tags make this richer ("race pace trend over 3 years", "interval-session frequency vs PB trajectory"). Read-only analytics over `activities` — no new writes. | This is why eight years of history was imported and made canonical: Anton's endgame is *insight*, not logging. | R2.3, R2.7 T1, R5.4 helps | High |
| R5.6 | **Documentation as infrastructure, permanently** | The Phase-2 (implementation) workflow from `documentation_creation.md`: milestone plans executed by cheaper coding agents, with `project_state.md` / `roadmap.md` / `design_decisions.md` updated continuously as living artifacts. | The meta-bet of this whole program: sessions that start with accurate context outperform sessions that start with archaeology. | R1.1 | Ongoing |

**Order within R5:** 5.2 and the R5.1 contract spike can start once R2 lands; 5.3 anytime after R2.4; 5.4/5.5 follow data needs, not a schedule.

## Dependency Spine (the short version)

```
R1 (loose ends) ─▶ R2 (security · schema · platform — complete 2026-07-08)
                        │
                        ▼
                  RA1 Remote backend (auth v2 + always-on host + cutover)   ← executes R5.2
                        │            RA1.0 D0/spikes → (RA1.1 ∥ RA1.2) → RA1.3+RA1.4 → RA1.5 → RA1.6
                        ├▶ R3 agents (parked) ─▶ R4 automation (parked) ─▶ RA2 remote clients ─▶ R5.1 Mobile
                        └▶ (RA2 can also precede R3/R4 if the pocket UI matters sooner)
R2.7 Training Depth (complete): T1 → T2 → T3 · T1 → T4/T5/T6 · T6 → T7 · T2 → T8
R2.5 Observability ─▶ R4.1 Scheduling ─▶ R4.2/4.5
R3.5 Channel ─▶ everything proactive
R2.7 T5 (fitness metrics) ─▶ R3.4 (fitness resource) ─▶ R3.6 (race advisor richer)
```

Three rules fall out of the spine: **nothing unattended before R2.1** (satisfied), **nothing scheduled before R2.5** (satisfied), and **nothing internet-exposed before RA1's auth v2 + TLS land together** — a public bind with the single shared cleartext token is a regression, not an intermediate state. Everything else is negotiable in order.

*Maintenance note: this file is a living artifact (see R5.6). When an item ships, move its row into `project_state.md` §3 and record any decision it embodied in `design_decisions.md`. When priorities change, re-order here and say why in the changelog entry — the roadmap's history is part of the roadmap.*
