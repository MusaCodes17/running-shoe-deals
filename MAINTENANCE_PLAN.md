# MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md — Post-R4 Defects, Debt & Housekeeping

**Written:** 2026-07-13 (full-repo review session; Claude web). **Updated:** 2026-07-14 — D7/D8 scraper defects added from live UI observation; I1 New-Retailer Onboarding Agent added; RA1.5 explicitly deferred pending the hosting decision (Fly.io vs Hetzner, D0), defects block now leads.
**Status:** executing contract for the next several sessions. **RA1.5 is deferred by decision (2026-07-14)** until the hosting choice is made; §0 stays in the plan untouched as the parked queue.
**Sources reconciled:** `docs/project_state.md` (2026-07-10 snapshot), `refactoring/tech_debt.md` ledger, `refactoring/refactor.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, root-doc inventory, `.gitignore`.
**Conventions:** one commit per lettered task, `mx:` prefix (maintenance), suite green each session, backend-with-tests before UI, E4 bar on any migration.

## 0. Urgent — do these first (human, not Claude Code)

| # | Action | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| U1 | **Execute RA1.5 cutover** | Everything else in this plan is secondary. Provision the VM (Fly.io / Hetzner CX22 per D0), DNS, fill `deploy/.env.production`, deploy, E4 count reconciliation (933+ activities), re-point Claude Desktop, add the claude.ai connector. Runbook: `REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md` §6/§7. |
| U2 | **RA1.4 human steps (at/with U1)** | Provision Backblaze B2 bucket + `LITESTREAM_*` vars; run the restore drill (`deploy/restore.sh` to a scratch path, verify activity count); pull laptop snapshot post-cutover (`deploy/pull-snapshot.sh`). |
| U3 | **RA1.3 human step** | External uptime pinger on `/health` before cutover completes. |
| U4 | **RA1.6 docs reconciliation** | After cutover: `architecture.md` §11 internet trust model; A1 amended; E9 finalized; `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md` remote URL. (Claude Code session, but gated on U1.) |

## 1. Defects (open, verified against the ledger 2026-07-13)

Ordered by risk to live data / feed honesty.

| # | Defect | Source | Fix sketch | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Shoe deletion bypasses rotation semantics + SQLite FK enforcement is off process-wide** (`PRAGMA foreign_keys` never set → every FK advisory; `DELETE /owned-shoes/{id}` leaves orphaned activities and dangling `planned_shoe_id`/gear refs). | tech_debt P1-3 / §11.4; refactor.md H3 | Connection-event hook setting the pragma in `database.py`; run `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` against the live DB first; add sanctioned `rotation.delete_owned_shoe()`. **Do before RA1.5 if possible — a remote host is a worse place to discover orphaned rows.** | Medium |
| D2 | ✅ **Done 2026-07-08 (bcdddc2)** — `scrape_retailer_for_shoe` tracks `searched_urls` (every URL returned by search) alongside `fetched_urls` (successful detail fetches) and orphan-retires against their union. `test_partial_detail_failure_does_not_orphan_a_live_deal` is a real pass (was never truly xfail after the fix). No code change needed in this session; stale module comment in `test_orchestrator.py` updated. | tech_debt P1-2 / §11.3; refactor.md H2 | ✅ Fixed | — |
| D3 | **`sync_coros_runs` prompt-vs-practice dedup asymmetry** — verify live that confirmed runs carry `coros_activity_id`; practiced protocol may be protected only by the date/±0.1 km fallback tier. | tech_debt §11.6; refactor.md M5 | One verification session against the live DB (recent runs have IDs?); two-line MCP-tool fix if not. Cheap; protects INV never-double-count. | Low |
| D4 | **Small verified hazards batch:** `trigger_scrape` advisory always reports 0 deals (dict iterated as list — wrong AI-facing signal); `is_already_logged` compares ISO string to `Date` column (SQLite-only correctness — matters more once the DB lives in a container); promo-code sort `TypeError` on uncommitted row; brand matching case-sensitive REST vs `ilike` MCP. | tech_debt §11.14; refactor.md L1/L5/L4e | One batched `mx:` commit + regression tests. | Low |
| D5 | **P2.3 price-history sparkline — status unknown.** project_state says "probably not built; check `Deals.jsx`." | project_state §4 | 5-minute check; either strike it from §4 or schedule as an improvement (I3). | Trivial |
| D6 | **Test-suite env leak** — 1 pre-existing failure in `test_schedule.py` (322/323). | project_state §2 | Isolate the env var leak (likely `SCRAPE_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` bleeding between tests via `monkeypatch` scope); restore 323/323. | Low |
| D7 | ✅ **Done 2026-07-14** — (a) `is_kids_shoe` extended to variadic `*texts`; `search_products_filtered` now passes name + product_url; (b) `_is_youth_size(label)` added to `ShopifyScraper`; variant loop restructured to read label first and skip Y/C-suffix variants before adding to price pool or `sizes_available`. 26 tests in `test_kids_filter.py`. Note: configurable adult size floor (US 7) deferred — Y/C suffix detection handles the egregious JD Sports cases; a floor adds complexity for little gain given the name/URL filter. | UI observation (Musa, 2026-07-14) + code read | ✅ Fixed | — |
| D8 | ✅ **Done 2026-07-14** — orchestrator `scrape_retailer_for_shoe` now requires `below_msrp AND is_stocked`; OOS products retire any active deal (requalifies on next scrape). Shopify `available` default flipped to `False`. `ShoeProductCard` already showed "Out of stock" badge (belt-and-braces confirmed already in place). 3 new tests in `test_orchestrator.py`. | UI observation (Musa, 2026-07-14) + code read | ✅ Fixed | — |

## 2. Tech debt (open P1s and worth-doing P2s)

| # | Item | Source | Direction | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | **`mcp_server.py` god object** — ~22 tools + 10 resources + prompts + hand-rolled serializers + embedded business rules (600/700/800 km messages, review template) REST can't see. | P1-6 | Extract serializers to a `services/serializers.py` (pairs with T2); move threshold/review copy into `rotation`; split tool registration by domain module. | High (own session) |
| T2 | **Dual serialization** — Pydantic REST vs `_*_to_dict` MCP; owned-shoe shape exists in ≥3 hand-synced renderings. The standing source of the next "numbers disagree" bug. | P1-7 | Single serializer layer both surfaces call. Do with/after T1. | High |
| T3 | **`status` vocabulary unvalidated** (the surviving half of P1-5 after R2.4 fixed `shoe_type`). | P1-5 / M2 | Same pattern as R2.4: backend-owned tuple + write-time 422 + tiny migration-free sweep of live values. | Low |
| T4 | **Migrations never exercised by the suite** — `conftest` uses `create_all`; the Alembic path production depends on has no automated check. | §8.3 | One test: fresh SQLite → `alembic upgrade head` → assert schema matches `create_all` metadata (or simply that it applies + key tables exist). | Low |
| T5 | **Deal-domain test gaps** — retirement/requalification, orphan guard (lands with D2), promo manual-beats-scraped still uncovered. | P1-4 / §8.1 | refactor.md H1's stub-scraper truth table. Fold the D2 tests in. | Medium |
| T6 | **`models/__init__.py` façade stale** — missing the Phase-5 era exports, exporting unused schemas. | §9.1 | One sweep commit. | Trivial |
| T7 | **`Retailer.scraper_config` untyped blob** + model comment still describes the retired CSS-selector era. | §10.2 | TypedDict/Pydantic shape for the Algolia credential payload; fix comment. | Low |
| T8 | **`tech_debt.md` ledger itself is stale** — P1-9 (schema authority) and P1-10 (fat routers) shown Active/Scheduled but both resolved (R2.2 2026-07-07; deals/dashboard extraction 2026-07-10); §9.2 INVARIANTS shown Active but CLAUDE.md §14 exists; suite count says 64. | this review | Reconciliation pass striking resolved rows with dates — the ledger is only useful if trustworthy. | Low |
| T9 | **`.gitignore` gaps** — root `.pytest_cache/` and `.venv/` are not ignored at root level (currently only convention keeps them out). | this review | Add `.pytest_cache/` and `.venv/` to root `.gitignore`. | Trivial |
| T10 | **ShoeRun proxy trap (residual)** — all five current seams eager-load (R1.4), but the N+1/`filter()` trap remains armed for any *new* run-list code. | P1-1 | No action now; kept on the ledger. Optional: refactor.md H4's `contains_eager` helper to make the safe path the easy path. | — |

## 2.5 New improvements (added 2026-07-14)

| # | Item | Detail | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | **New-Retailer Onboarding Agent** (roadmap candidate **R4.6**). When a retailer is added (via Settings → Retailers or MCP) without a working scraper, an agent workflow takes it from "row in the DB" to "scraping or honestly declared unscrapable": (1) detect retailers with no successful `scrape_runs` entry and no/empty `scraper_config`; (2) run the existing `platform_detection` (Shopify/Algolia sniff) against the base URL; (3) run the scrapability dry-run (`POST /shoes/test` path) with a known shoe; (4) report findings + proposed `scraper_config` via a new `onboard_retailer` MCP tool + `retailer_onboarding` prompt — **C9 confirmation gate before any config write**; unscrapable outcomes get recorded on the retailer row (the Sporting Life precedent) so the watchdog doesn't nag. Builds entirely on existing pieces (`platform_detection.py`, dry-run endpoint, `scrape_health`); the agent is mostly orchestration + one write path. Surfaces in `scrape_health` as a `needs_onboarding` list so the R4.2 Scrape-Reliability watchdog and this share one health view. | Medium |

---

## 3. Housekeeping (docs & repo hygiene)

| # | Item | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | ✅ **Done 2026-07-13** — `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` + `QUICKSTART.md` archived to `docs/archive/` (actively wrong: pre-Alembic, `seed_data.py`/`run.py` era, delete-the-DB advice). See `docs/archive/README.md`. Commit the move. |
| H2 | **Relocate completed root plans** to `docs/archive/`: `REDESIGN_PLAN.md`, `SECURITY_PASS_PLAN.md`, `TRAINING_DEPTH_PLAN.md`, `CHAT_PERSISTENCE_PLAN.md`, `REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, `UI_REVIEW_TASKS.md`, `STRAVA_IMPORT_REVIEW_TASKS.md`, `strava-historical-import-plan.md`, `documentation_creation.md`. **Requires a cross-reference sweep first** (`grep -rn` each filename across `docs/`, `refactoring/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/`) and path updates — these are cited as historical anchors. Keep at root: `CLAUDE.md`, `REMOTE_ACCESS_PLAN.md` (live runbook until RA1.6), `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md`, this file. |
| H3 | **Chat SYSTEM_PROMPT still introduces the assistant by the old product name** — the one user-visible pre-brand string (tech_debt §2.4 / refactor.md L4b). Fix with R1 of the rename below. |
| H4 | **Stray root artifacts** — `training-default.png` (gitignored scratch screenshot) and `.DS_Store` files: delete locally at will; nothing to commit. |

## 4. Rename: `running-shoe-deals` → `anton` (supersedes E6's "keep for now")

E6 deliberately deferred this; the RA milestone makes now the right moment — do it **before** RA1.5 so the deployed host, image names, and connector URL are born with the final name, or immediately **after** cutover as one atomic pass. Do not do it mid-cutover.

**R1 — In-repo strings (Claude Code session, safe anytime):**
- FastAPI `title` ("Running Shoe Deal Finder" → "Anton") in `main.py`; OAuth login page title if branded; `docker-compose.yml` service/container names; `deploy/Caddyfile` comments; chat `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (H3); README header; `pyproject`/`package.json` name fields if set. DB filename stays (`~/anton-data/` path is name-neutral; renaming the SQLite file buys nothing and risks the Litestream config — leave it, note in E6's successor entry).
- `grep -rin "running.shoe.deal\|rundeals" --include="*.py" --include="*.js*" --include="*.html" --include="*.yml" --include="*.md"` must return only historical docs/changelog mentions.

**R2 — GitHub rename (you, ~2 min):**
1. GitHub → repo → Settings → rename to `anton` (or `gh repo rename anton` with gh CLI). GitHub auto-redirects the old name for clones/fetches/issues.
2. Update the local remote anyway (redirects are a crutch): `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<you>/anton.git`.

**R3 — Local folder rename (you, ~10 min — this is the breaking one):**
1. Quit Claude Desktop and any Claude Code sessions rooted in the repo.
2. `mv ~/Workspace/claude-code/running-shoe-deals ~/Workspace/claude-code/anton`
3. **Recreate the venv** (venvs embed absolute paths): `cd anton && rm -rf .venv && python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.
4. Update every absolute path that references the old folder: Claude Desktop MCP config (`claude_desktop_config.json` — the Anton server entry and Filesystem allowed dirs if repo-scoped), any launchd/cron entries, editor workspaces, `frontend` `.env` if it hardcodes paths.
5. Sanity pass: backend boots (`alembic upgrade head` runs), suite green, SPA builds, Claude Desktop lists Anton tools.

**R4 — Docs:** design_decisions E6 → Superseded (record the rename + what deliberately kept the old name: DB filename); changelog entry; project_state repo-name line.

## 5. Next steps for the application (resequenced 2026-07-14 — defects lead, RA1.5 parked)

1. ~~**Defect block A (scraper honesty):**~~ ✅ **Done 2026-07-14** — D8 (OOS qualification guard + Shopify pessimistic default, 3 tests) + D2 (confirmed already fixed, comment cleaned up) + D7 (composite kids filter + youth-size exclusion, 26 tests). Suite 323 → 352.
2. **Defect block B (data integrity):** D1 (FK pragma + sanctioned shoe delete) → D3/D4 batch → D6.
3. **I1 New-Retailer Onboarding Agent** — natural follow-on to block A since it reuses the same dry-run/health plumbing just touched.
4. **RA1.5 + §0 queue** — resumes once the hosting decision (Fly.io vs Hetzner CX22, D0) is made. Note D1, D7, D8 all improve what gets deployed, so the deferral has a silver lining.
5. **RA1.6** docs reconciliation (U4) after cutover.
6. **Rename** (§4) around cutover.
7. **RA2 begins to matter:** remote SPA behind real session auth, then the PWA pass — the stepping stones to R5.1 native. Own plan doc when scheduled (roadmap RA2).
8. **R3.5 revisit trigger watch:** now that R4.1 nightly scraping runs unattended, the first "the watchdog fired / a deal alert existed and I never saw it" moment is the designed trigger to build the notification channel — which then unblocks roadmap R4.2 (agent scheduling) and R4.3 (COROS sync nudge).
9. **Debt block:** T1+T2 (the serializer unification — biggest remaining structural item), then T3–T7 as filler tasks.
10. **R5 horizon:** R5.3 purchase-loop closure is the cheapest narrative win (watch → buy → run → retire → replace); R5.4/R5.5 (FIT-file depth, longitudinal analytics) follow felt data needs.
